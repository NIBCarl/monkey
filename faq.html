                        <p>There's technically no minimum investment amount for EMERSON. However, you should consider Ethereum gas fees, which can make very small purchases inefficient. We recommend having at least $50-100 worth of ETH to cover both your desired EMERSON purchase and the associated gas fees.</p>

                        <p>Slippage is the potential difference between the expected price of a trade and the executed price. Because crypto markets can be volatile and EMERSON has a small buy/sell tax, we recommend setting your slippage to 2-3% to ensure your transaction goes through successfully.</p>
